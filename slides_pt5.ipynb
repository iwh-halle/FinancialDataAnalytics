    "[Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a coding paradigm that represents **real-world entities as \"objects\"** in programming. These objects have **attributes (data)** and **behavior (methods)**, which can be manipulated to solve complex problems. Python, with its clear syntax and powerful in-built tools, is a popular language for implementing OOP.\n",

    "In the context of financial economics, OOP can be particularly useful due to its abstraction and modularity. Financial instruments, for instance, can be modeled as objects. A **bond** could be an object with attributes such as **coupon rate, face value, maturity date** and methods to calculate **present value, yield to maturity, and risk measures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class, which is a blueprint for creating objects**, could be designed for a bond. From this class, you can create multiple bond objects, each representing a specific bond in the market.\n",

    "Inheritance, another key feature of OOP, allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. This can represent financial concepts like hierarchies of asset classes. For example, a Bond class could inherit from a more general Security class, as all bonds are securities but have additional unique properties.\n",

    "Through encapsulation, OOP allows data and methods to be bundled together, keeping code clean, reusable, and easy to maintain. Polymorphism, another crucial concept in OOP, allows methods to perform differently based on the object calling them. This is useful when dealing with a variety of financial instruments that might share similar methods but require different implementations. For instance, the method to calculate yield might differ between a bond and a stock, despite the shared name.\n",

This design makes individual modules more reusable and changes in one module less likely to impact others.

Please note that there are **size limits on the files and the overall repository [(see HERE)](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)**. Therefore, in general, we do not want to use Git/GitHub as a storage for (large) data files or databases.

    "The main purpose of the \".gitignore\" file is to exclude files that are generated during the development process, contain sensitive information, or are not necessary for the project's functioning. For example, build artifacts, log files, temporary files, and configuration files specific to individual developers or their environments can be safely ignored.\n",

However, if a file is already being tracked by Git before it's added to the \".gitignore\" file, it will continue to be tracked even if it matches the specified patterns. In such cases, you need to explicitly remove the file from Git using the \"git rm\" command.\n",

    "For the exchange of very large files, one might consider the .feather file standard. A .feather file is a binary file format for storing data frames. It is part of the Apache Arrow project and was developed by Wes McKinney and Hadley Wickham to support the exchange of datasets between Python and R. The format is designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use, and it provides full support for data frame APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the Feather format include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Language Agnostic: Feather uses the Apache Arrow columnar memory specification to represent binary data on disk. This makes it easy to read the data into popular data analysis languages like Python (pandas), R, and others.\n",
    "* Speed: Feather efficiently uses the available system resources (like multi-core CPUs and fast disk drives) to enable high-speed read and write operations. Reading from and writing to Feather files is typically faster than with CSV or other text-based formats because data is stored in a binary format.\n",
    "* No Data Copy: Feather stores data in a way that's nearly identical to its in-memory representation, which means there's no need to copy the data when reading it from disk. This also means that Feather files can be memory-mapped, which is a technique that allows programs to access files on disk as if they were part of the program's main memory.\n",
    "* Metadata Compatibility: Feather files can hold all kinds of metadata, which is important in statistical data sets. It can store column names, types, and other important attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that Feather was not designed to be a long-term storage format. So while it's great for exchanging data between tools that understand the format, it might not be ideal for storing data for many years."

    "# Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language offers an enormous variety of libraries and modules that allow developers to implement diverse functionalities. Often, each Python project requires a specific set of libraries and may even depend on certain versions of these libraries. However, installing and managing different versions of the same library globally on your system for different projects can lead to conflicts and incompatibility issues. This is where virtual environments come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a virtual environment is a self-contained directory that encapsulates a specific Python interpreter and its associated packages and dependencies. It allows you to create isolated environments with their own set of installed libraries, independent of the globally installed packages on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are useful when you're working on multiple projects or collaborating with others, as they help ensure that each project has its own independent set of dependencies. This way, you can avoid conflicts between different versions of packages required by different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment in Python, you can use the built-in module called venv (available in Python 3.3 and higher) or third-party tools like virtualenv or conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "Environments are particularly useful when working on different projects that require different versions of packages or when collaborating with others who have different package requirements. They provide a reliable and reproducible way to manage and isolate your project's dependencies. **This might be relevant for the code submitted for this course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda environments are isolated environments created by the Conda package manager. Conda is a popular package management system used primarily in the Python ecosystem, although it can also manage packages for other programming languages. In my humble opinion:\n",
    "* Virtual environments are good programming practice!\n",
    "* Conda is more convenient if you already use Anaconda.\n",
    "* Conda can do (install) a bit more than PIP [(see HERE)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20994716/what-is-the-difference-between-pip-and-conda).\n",
    "* Using Conda and PIP to install packages into the same environnement can get you into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "See:\n",
    "* https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "conda create -n myenv python=3.10 pip numpy scipy pandas spyder # Make sure you install pip directly here!\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "# Install additional packages, e.g.:\n",
    "conda install sqalchemy\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your newly created environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "# Have fun!\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the whole idea was to be able to provide a reliable and reproducible way to manage and isolate your project's dependencies. So lets save our environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "conda env export > requirements.yml  # Create a list of packages that is Conda compatible\n",
    "pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt  # Create a list of packages that is PIP compatible\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should have created two files (requirements.yml and requirements.txt). We can use these files, for example on a different system, to reproduce the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "conda env create -f requirements.yml  # Install for the first time from .yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We are therefore able to share the exact and hopefully tested environment, such that a third person can reproduce our exact results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Venv environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The venv module provides a convenient way to create virtual environments, which are self-contained environments with their own separate set of Python packages installed in dedicated directories. A virtual environment is built upon an existing Python installation, referred to as the \"base\" Python, and it can be configured to be isolated from the packages installed in the base environment. This isolation ensures that only the packages explicitly installed within the virtual environment are accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "When operating within a virtual environment, popular installation tools like pip automatically install Python packages into the virtual environment without requiring explicit instructions to do so. This streamlined process allows for seamless package management within the virtual environment.\n",

    "In Python, [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) is a standard library module used to track events or issues that occur when software runs. The logging module offers a full-featured and flexible logging system. At its simplest, log messages are sent to a log file or the console. However, you can also configure loggers to send messages to various other locations, including network sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging provides several benefits over using print statements:\n",

    "1. It provides a way to categorize and prioritize your log messages. This is done using log levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. It is easy to differentiate regular output from debugging information. This is because logging provides a way to \"turn off\" or \"turn on\" messages of various importance.\n",
